# NFR Validation Results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All endpoints verify project ownership. Input validation (10MB limit, MIME whitelist, category auto-correction). Audit logging for upload/download/delete. Rate limiting and virus scanning acceptable for MVP."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Thumbnail optimization (200x200px JPEG 80%). Cursor-based pagination. Minor optimizations available: async thumbnail generation (~10-50ms blocking), lazy loading for >100 docs."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful error degradation. Soft delete preserves audit trail. Proper blob URL cleanup. User-friendly error messages."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "TypeScript strict mode. Comprehensive JSDoc. Clean architecture with service/router/component separation. Well-structured tests."

# Risk Summary

  totals: { critical: 0, high: 1, medium: 0, low: 0 }
  highest:
    score: 9
    category: "Functional"
    issue: "Category filtering broken (FIXED)"
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Category ID mismatch - COMPLETED during review"
    monitor:
      - "Thumbnail generation latency (~10-50ms) - acceptable for MVP, consider async queue for scale"
      - "Missing rate limiting - add before production"
      - "Missing virus scanning - add before production"
