# Real Estate Development Tracker

A comprehensive web application for managing real estate development projects, tracking costs, managing contacts, and providing transparent partner dashboards.

## Overview

The Real Estate Development Tracker is a full-stack web application designed to streamline project management for real estate developers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and Bun (recommended) or npm
- Git
- SQLite (for local development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd realestate-portfolio
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
# Using Bun (recommended)
bun install

# Or using npm
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your configuration
```

See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for required values.

4. Initialize the database:

```bash
# Using Bun
bun run db:migrate
bun run db:seed  # Optional: Add sample data

# Or using npm
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
```

5. Start the development server:

```bash
# Using Bun
bun run dev

# Or using npm
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript compiler
- `npm run db:migrate` - Run database migrations
- `npm run db:seed` - Seed database with sample data
- `npm run db:reset` - Reset database (development only)

### Code Standards

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Write unit tests for critical business logic
- Follow the established folder structure
- Use conventional commits for version control

### Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Implement changes following coding standards
3. Run tests and linting before committing
4. Create a pull request with clear description
5. Ensure CI checks pass before merging

## Environment Variables
