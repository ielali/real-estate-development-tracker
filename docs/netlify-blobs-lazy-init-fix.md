# Netlify Blobs - Lazy Initialization Fix

## Issue

When running the application with `npm run dev` or `bun run dev`, the DocumentService would crash on module load with:

```
Error [MissingBlobsEnvironmentError]: The environment has not been configured to use Netlify Blobs.
To use it manually, supply the following properties when creating a store: deployID
```

This happened because:

1. The DocumentService was initializing the blob store in the constructor
2. The constructor ran when the module loaded
3. Netlify Blobs environment wasn't available during module load when not using `netlify dev`

## Solution

Implemented **lazy initialization** of the blob store using a TypeScript getter.

### Before (Immediate Initialization)

```typescript
export class DocumentService {
  private store: ReturnType<typeof getStore>

  constructor() {
    this.store = getBlobStore("documents") // ❌ Fails immediately if env not ready
  }
}
```

### After (Lazy Initialization)

```typescript
export class DocumentService {
  private _store: ReturnType<typeof getStore> | null = null

  private get store(): ReturnType<typeof getStore> {
    if (!this._store) {
      try {
        this._store = getBlobStore("documents") // ✅ Only initialized when accessed
      } catch (error) {
        if (error instanceof Error && error.message.includes("MissingBlobsEnvironmentError")) {
          throw new TRPCError({
            code: "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR",
            message:
              "Netlify Blobs is not configured. Please run 'netlify dev' instead of 'npm run dev' for local development.",
          })
        }
        throw error
      }
    }
    return this._store
  }
}
```

## Benefits

### 1. No Module Load Crashes ✅

- The blob store is only initialized when actually used
- Module can import successfully even when Netlify environment isn't available
- Prevents cascade failures in the application

### 2. Better Error Messages ✅

- Clear, actionable error message when blob operations are attempted without proper env
- Tells developers exactly what to do: "run 'netlify dev' instead"
- No cryptic stack traces

### 3. Backward Compatible ✅

- No changes to the public API
- All existing code continues to work
- Tests remain unchanged

## How It Works

1. **Module Load**: `DocumentService` imported → No store initialization → No error
2. **First Use**: `store` getter called → Attempts to initialize → Success or helpful error
3. **Subsequent Uses**: `store` getter called → Returns cached instance → Fast access

## Developer Experience

### Before Fix

```bash
$ npm run dev
# Application crashes immediately
Error [MissingBlobsEnvironmentError]: ...
```

### After Fix

```bash
$ npm run dev
# Application starts successfully

# Later, when document upload is attempted:
TRPCError: Netlify Blobs is not configured.
Please run 'netlify dev' instead of 'npm run dev' for local development.
```

## Files Changed

- [apps/web/src/server/services/document.service.ts](../apps/web/src/server/services/document.service.ts)
  - Changed `store` from eager to lazy initialization
  - Added error handling with helpful message

- [docs/netlify-blobs-configuration.md](./netlify-blobs-configuration.md)
  - Added technical details about lazy initialization
  - Updated troubleshooting section

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **With `netlify dev`** ✅
   - Blob store initializes successfully
   - All document operations work

2. **With `npm run dev`** ✅
   - Application starts without errors
   - Clear error message when blob operations attempted

3. **In Production** ✅
   - Blob store uses global store with strong consistency
   - All operations work as expected

4. **In Tests** ✅
   - Mocked blob store works correctly
   - No initialization errors

## Best Practices Applied

### 1. Lazy Initialization Pattern

- Delay expensive operations until needed
- Prevent module load-time failures
- Better startup performance

### 2. Clear Error Messages

- Tell users what went wrong
- Provide actionable solution
- No technical jargon

### 3. Graceful Degradation

- Application doesn't crash on import
- Errors only occur when feature is used
- Better overall reliability
