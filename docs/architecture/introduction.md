# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Real Estate Development Tracker, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the PRD analysis and technical assumptions, this is a **greenfield project** that should leverage Next.js 14+ with the modern component ecosystem. Given the specified tech stack requirements:

**Recommended Foundation:**
- **Next.js 14+ with App Router** as the core fullstack framework
- **Shadcn/ui component library** for professional UI components
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling system
- **TypeScript** for type safety across the stack
- **Turborepo** for monorepo management

Rather than using a comprehensive starter like T3 Stack, the PRD specifically calls for Shadcn/ui components, which provides a more curated, customizable approach. This allows for:
- Professional, accessible components out of the box
- Full customization control for real estate branding
- Excellent mobile-first responsive design
- Integration with Tailwind's design system

**Decision:** Greenfield project using Next.js + Shadcn/ui foundation for maximum flexibility and professional aesthetics.
