- âœ… Dynamic contact search: Server-side search with debouncing
- âœ… Recent contacts tracking: Last 5 contacts per project
- âœ… Document upload verified: Drag-and-drop, batch, progress indicators

**Bug Fixes & Improvements:**

- âœ… Fixed QuickActions navigation routes
- âœ… Fixed contact search keyboard event handling
- âœ… Fixed ContactSelector data structure handling
- âœ… Optimized contact loading (dynamic vs eager)

**Remaining Tasks:**

**Loading States:**

- [ ] Skeleton screens for data tables
- [ ] Progressive loading for dashboards
- âœ… Optimistic updates for form submissions (already implemented)

**Error Handling:**

- [ ] Verify inline validation with clear error messages
- âœ… Toast notifications for success/error states (already implemented)
- [ ] Retry mechanisms for failed operations

**Contextual Help:**

- âœ… Tooltips components created (phase 2)
- [ ] Empty state guidance ("No costs yet - add your first cost")
- [ ] Integrate tooltips throughout application

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Navigation restructured with breadcrumbs
- [x] Cost entry form optimized (templates, auto-save)
- [x] Document upload supports drag-and-drop and batch
- [x] Contact selection optimized (search, recent contacts)
- [ ] All data tables show skeleton loading states
- [ ] Form errors display inline with clear messaging
- [ ] Empty states provide guidance
- [ ] All tooltips integrated for complex fields

### Story 5.3: Mobile Optimization & Accessibility Compliance

**Objective:** Ensure mobile-first responsiveness and WCAG AA compliance

**Tasks:**

**Mobile-First Responsive Improvements:**

- Touch-friendly button sizes (min 44x44px)
- Simplified mobile layouts for tables (card view alternatives)
- Optimized forms for mobile keyboards (appropriate input types)
- Bottom navigation for mobile (thumb-friendly)
- Swipe gestures for common actions (delete, edit)

**Accessibility Enhancements (WCAG AA):**

- Semantic HTML throughout
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation for all workflows
- Focus indicators and skip links
- Color contrast compliance (4.5:1 ratio)
- Screen reader testing and fixes

**Visual Polish and Consistency:**

- Unified color palette with proper contrast
- Consistent typography scale
- Standard spacing system (4px/8px grid)
- Professional iconography throughout
- Subtle animations and transitions (not excessive)
- Dark mode support (if quick win)

**Performance Optimization:**

- Image optimization (Next.js Image component)
- Code splitting for large pages
- Prefetching for navigation
- Lighthouse score >90 (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] All buttons meet minimum touch target size (44x44px)
- [ ] Tables have mobile-friendly card view
- [ ] Forms use appropriate input types (tel, email, number)
- [ ] WCAG AA audit passed (axe DevTools)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works for all workflows
- [ ] Color contrast ratios meet 4.5:1 minimum
- [ ] Screen reader testing completed with no critical issues
- [ ] Lighthouse mobile score >90 for key pages
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile device testing completed (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] No functional changes - all existing features work identically
- [x] No database schema changes required
- [x] All existing API endpoints unchanged
- [x] Backward compatible with existing user workflows
- [x] No breaking changes to component interfaces

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** UI changes could confuse existing users or break familiar workflows

**Mitigation:** A/B testing for major navigation changes, staged rollout, user feedback sessions, revert capability for individual components

**Rollback Plan:** UI components are isolated, can revert individual screens; CSS changes can be rolled back via version control

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] WCAG AA accessibility audit passed (using axe DevTools or similar)
- [ ] Lighthouse mobile score >90 for key pages
- [ ] All existing functionality verified (regression testing)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile device testing (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- [ ] User acceptance testing with 2-3 real developers/partners
- [ ] Design system documentation updated
- [ ] No regression in functionality or performance
- [ ] Partner feedback collected and addressed

## Story Manager Handoff

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is a refinement to an existing MVP system running Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- Integration points: All existing pages and components from Epics 1-4
- Existing patterns to maintain: Shadcn/ui component library, tRPC API calls, React Query state management
- Critical compatibility requirements: No functional changes, all existing workflows must work identically
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact
- Focus on incremental improvements with ability to rollback individual changes

The epic should elevate the professional polish and usability of the platform without disrupting current users."
