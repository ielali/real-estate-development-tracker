I want to create, read, update, and delete projects,
so that I can manage multiple development projects.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Project creation form with name, address, start date fields
2: Projects list view showing all user's projects as cards
3: Project detail page displaying project information
4: Edit functionality to update project details
5: Soft delete capability to archive projects
6: Proper validation and error handling on all operations

## Story 1.5: Basic Cost Tracking

4: Date picker defaults to today for quick entry
5: Mobile-optimized form with large touch targets
6: Success feedback after cost addition
7: Edit and delete cost functionality with proper validation
8: Action buttons disabled during loading/mutations to prevent race conditions
9: Category properly populated on edit form load
10: Add cost button only available after data loads

### Additional Enhancements Implemented

- **Navigation:** Projects menu item shows as active when viewing/editing individual projects
- **Project Forms:** Description field upgraded to multi-line textarea for better UX
- **Maps Integration:** Google Maps display on project detail page showing address with marker
- **UI/UX:** Consistent Navbar across all pages, proper loading states, disabled buttons during mutations

## Story 1.6: Deployment Pipeline & External Services Setup

As a developer,
I want to configure CI/CD and external services,
so that the application can be deployed and all features are functional.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Vercel project setup:

- .github/workflows/deploy.yml for production deployments
  3: External service configuration:
- Resend account created and API key obtained
- Resend API key added to environment variables
- Email templates created for partner invitations
- Vercel Blob storage enabled and configured
- Blob storage token added to environment variables
  4: Environment configuration:
- .env.example file created with all required variables
- .env.local configured for local development
- Production environment variables set in Vercel
- Documentation of all environment variables

## Story 1.7: Development Documentation & Standards

As a developer,
I want to establish documentation standards and initial docs,
so that the project is maintainable and onboardable.
