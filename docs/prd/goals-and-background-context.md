# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Successfully manage all active real estate development projects in a single platform
- Reduce partner update preparation time from 3-5 hours to under 30 minutes
- Track 100% of project costs in real-time with proper categorization for tax purposes
- Provide instant professional transparency to all business partners via secure dashboards
- Consolidate fragmented tools (spreadsheets, folders, photos) into one mobile-friendly system
- Build reliable historical data foundation for project analysis and informed decision-making

## Background Context
Real estate developers currently manage multi-million dollar projects across disconnected tools never designed for this purpose - Excel for costs, cloud folders for documents, personal contact lists for vendors, and manual processes for partner updates. This fragmentation creates compounding inefficiencies as projects scale, leading to 3-5 hours weekly spent on updates, undetected budget overruns costing tens of thousands, and partner friction from lack of transparency.

The Real Estate Development Tracker transforms this chaos into a streamlined, purpose-built platform that acts as the single source of truth for development projects. By intelligently linking costs, events, documents, and stakeholders, it enables instant partner transparency and mobile-friendly on-site management, addressing the specific needs of Australian developers managing 2-10 concurrent projects.
