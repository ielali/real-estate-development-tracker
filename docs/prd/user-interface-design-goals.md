# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Create a clean, professional interface that feels native on mobile devices while maintaining desktop elegance. The design prioritizes quick data entry in the field, instant information retrieval, and professional presentation for partners - transforming chaotic project management into a calm, organized experience with smooth, polished interactions.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **One-tap actions** for common tasks (add cost, take photo, view project)
- **Progressive disclosure** showing summary views first with drill-down for details
- **Smart defaults** pre-filling categories and dates based on context
- **Swipe gestures** on mobile for quick navigation between projects
- **Inline editing** to update information without page transitions
- **Smooth animations** for transitions, loading states, and micro-interactions to enhance perceived performance and professionalism

## Core Screens and Views
- **Dashboard** - Project cards showing cost totals, recent activity, and progress indicators with subtle hover effects and smooth card transitions
- **Project Detail View** - Tabbed interface for costs, timeline, documents, contacts with animated tab switches
- **Quick Add Cost** - Mobile-optimized form with large touch targets, smart keyboard handling, and satisfying submission animations
- **Photo Capture** - Direct camera access with auto-association to current project and smooth preview transitions
- **Partner Dashboard** - Read-only professional view with charts and summaries featuring animated data visualizations
- **Contact Directory** - Searchable list with role filters and linked activity history with smooth filtering animations

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Ensure Level AA compliance with proper color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and clear focus indicators for professional accessibility. Animations respect prefers-reduced-motion settings.

## Branding
Clean, professional aesthetic using modern typography and subtle color accents. Emphasize data clarity over decorative elements. Mobile-first design that feels premium without being complex. Thoughtful use of animations (fade-ins, smooth scrolling, gentle transitions) to create a refined, high-quality feel.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Fully responsive Progressive Web App optimized for iOS Safari and Android Chrome on mobile, with desktop support for Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge.
