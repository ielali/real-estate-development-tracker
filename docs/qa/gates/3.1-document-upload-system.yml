  validated_measures:
    - "Input validation at multiple layers (client, service, router)"
    - "File size limits enforced (10MB)"
    - "MIME type whitelist (no executables or scripts)"
    - "Project ownership verification before all operations"
    - "UUID-based resource identifiers (non-enumerable)"
    - "Audit trail for compliance and forensics"
    - "Soft delete preserves data for audit"
    - "No file execution risk (files stored as blobs)"
    - "TRPCError codes don't leak sensitive information"
    - "Base64 encoding prevents binary injection"
