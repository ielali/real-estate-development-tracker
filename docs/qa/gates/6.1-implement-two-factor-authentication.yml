      MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS:
      - ✅ Password verification implemented (SEC-002 fixed)
      - ✅ Email notifications for all 2FA state changes (SEC-004 fixed)
      - ✅ Comprehensive security auditing in emails (IP, user agent, timestamp)

      REMAINING CONCERNS:
      - ⚠️ Server-side rate limiting not verified (SEC-001)
      - ⚠️ TOTP encryption relying on better-auth (SEC-003)

      Overall: Significantly improved security posture
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - QR generation async with loading states
      - Components properly lazy-loadable
      - No unnecessary re-renders
      - Minor: Some operations use window.location.reload (acceptable)
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Proper error boundaries in all dialogs
      - Form validation prevents invalid submissions
      - Loading states prevent duplicate submissions
      - Email failures non-blocking (good design)
      - Minor: Could add retry logic for better UX
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - ✅ JSDoc documentation added to all components (CODE-001 fixed)
      - Clean component structure and separation of concerns
      - Proper TypeScript types throughout
      - Good use of composition patterns
      - Minor: Some magic numbers could be constants
