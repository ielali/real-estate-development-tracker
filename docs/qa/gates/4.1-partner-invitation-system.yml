    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with TRPCError patterns, user-friendly messages, audit trail for all operations, soft delete pattern preserves data."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code quality with JSDoc comments on all functions, TypeScript strict mode, no 'any' types, clear separation of concerns, comprehensive test coverage."
