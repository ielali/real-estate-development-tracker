# Non-Functional Requirements Assessment
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Proper security headers in netlify.toml (X-Frame-Options, XSS-Protection, etc.). No sensitive data exposed."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent performance infrastructure. Netlify Lighthouse plugin enforces Performance 85+, Accessibility 100%, Best Practices 95+. Bundle analysis on each build. Mobile testing with realistic throttling (4G, 4x CPU)."

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive CI pipeline in Netlify with lint, type-check, test, migrate, build. Context-specific builds for production/preview/branch deploys. All tests pass locally."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Exceptional documentation quality. Clear testing guides for manual QA. Well-structured Netlify config with readable build commands. E2E tests are comprehensive and maintainable."

# Additional Context
notes: |
  **Re-Review Summary:**
  All critical issues from initial review have been resolved. The three missing files have been
  created with comprehensive, production-quality content:

  1. ✅ apps/web/e2e/tests/accessibility.spec.ts (10KB)
     - 5 comprehensive test suites covering WCAG AA compliance, keyboard navigation, form
       accessibility, mobile touch targets, and color contrast
     - Uses @axe-core/playwright for automated WCAG validation
     - Tests all major pages (home, projects, sign-in, sign-up)
     - Excellent test quality with detailed assertions

  2. ✅ docs/testing/keyboard-navigation-checklist.md (13KB)
     - Complete manual testing procedures for keyboard accessibility
     - Covers tab order, focus management, modals, interactive components
     - Includes specific test procedures for forms, buttons, dropdowns
     - Approval criteria checklist for QA validation

  3. ✅ docs/testing/screen-reader-testing.md (20KB)
     - Comprehensive screen reader testing guide
     - NVDA (Windows) and VoiceOver (macOS/iOS) procedures
     - Semantic HTML and ARIA requirements documented
     - Form accessibility and dynamic content testing procedures

  **Strategic Improvement - Netlify CI Migration:**
  GitHub Actions workflow has been replaced with Netlify native build system, which is a superior
  approach for this Netlify-deployed application:

  Benefits:
  - Single platform for build, test, and deploy
  - Native Netlify Lighthouse plugin for automated performance testing
  - Simpler configuration without separate GitHub secrets
  - Automatic deploy previews with performance testing on every PR
  - Integrated logging in Netlify dashboard

  The netlify.toml configuration is excellent:
  - Comprehensive CI pipeline (lint, type-check, test, migrate, build)
  - Lighthouse plugin with proper thresholds (Performance 85%, Accessibility 100%, Best Practices 95%)
  - Context-specific builds for production/preview/branch
  - Security headers properly configured

  **All Acceptance Criteria Met:**

  AC#1: Performance Benchmarks ✅
  - docs/performance-targets.md: Comprehensive benchmarks with Core Web Vitals targets
  - Lighthouse CI via Netlify plugin with proper thresholds
  - Bundle size budgets established (250KB initial, 100KB per-route)

  AC#2: Performance Testing ✅
  - Bundle size analysis on each build (du -sh .next in build command)
  - Performance regression alerts via Lighthouse plugin
  - Mobile performance testing supported (.lighthouserc.mobile.json config)

  AC#3: Accessibility Testing ✅
  - Automated a11y testing with axe-core (accessibility.spec.ts)
  - WCAG AA compliance checks via Lighthouse plugin (100% threshold)
  - Keyboard navigation checklist created (comprehensive manual testing guide)
  - Screen reader testing documented (NVDA/VoiceOver procedures)

  **Code Quality:**
  - TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
  - All dependencies installed correctly (@axe-core/playwright, @next/bundle-analyzer)
  - Test files use proper Playwright patterns and best practices
  - Documentation follows project markdown standards
  - File structure aligns with project conventions

  **Minor Observation (Not Blocking):**
  Playwright E2E tests are currently run manually (bunx playwright test) rather than integrated
  into the Netlify build. This is acceptable and documented as a future enhancement. The tests
  are comprehensive and ready to be added to CI when desired.

  **Recommendation:**
  Story is ready for "Done" status. Quality is exceptional with comprehensive testing
  infrastructure, excellent documentation, and strategic use of Netlify's native capabilities.

  **Time Invested:** Dev successfully resolved all QA feedback in ~30 minutes, demonstrating
  good responsiveness to quality concerns.
