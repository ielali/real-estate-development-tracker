# Code review findings
code_quality:
  strengths:
    - "Excellent TypeScript usage with strict types and proper interfaces"
    - "Comprehensive JSDoc documentation on all components and procedures"
    - "Mobile-first responsive design with 44px touch targets"
    - "Consistent use of established patterns (React Hook Form + Zod)"
    - "Proper error handling and loading states throughout"
    - "Well-organized file structure per project conventions"

  minor_observations:
    - "ContactSelector search lacks debounce (functional but could reduce re-renders)"
    - "Test coverage uses type validation pattern vs full rendering (acceptable, but consider integration tests)"
