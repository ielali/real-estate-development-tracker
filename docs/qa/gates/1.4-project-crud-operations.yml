# Quality Evidence
evidence:
  tests_reviewed: 11
  risks_identified: 2
  trace:
    ac_covered: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] # All ACs have implementation
    ac_gaps: [] # Backend fully tested, frontend tests deferred

# Non-Functional Requirements Assessment
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent access control - ownership checks on all mutations, protectedProcedure middleware, soft delete filtering prevents data leakage"

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with rollback on failure, proper validation at all boundaries"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code duplication eliminated via shared validation schemas, TypeScript strict mode passing, excellent documentation"
