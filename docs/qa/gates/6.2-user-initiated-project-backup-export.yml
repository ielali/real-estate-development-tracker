notes: |
  This story appears to be WORK IN PROGRESS, not ready for QA review. The developer has implemented
  ~40% of backend functionality but has not completed the implementation, written tests, or updated
  the story status to indicate readiness for review.

  POSITIVE ASPECTS:
  - Good architectural decisions (Drizzle relational queries, TypeScript types)
  - RBAC enforcement implemented correctly
  - Rate limiting with separate JSON/ZIP limits is well-designed
  - Schema design is sound with proper versioning
  - Error handling structure is mostly good

  CRITICAL BLOCKERS:
  - Critical bug in blob fetching will break ZIP downloads
  - Zero test coverage is unacceptable for backup/export functionality
  - UI completely missing
  - Cannot validate performance requirements without tests

  RECOMMENDATION:
  Developer should complete all implementation tasks, write comprehensive tests, run database
  migration, and update story status to "Review" before requesting QA review. Current gate
  status is FAIL due to incomplete implementation and critical bugs.
