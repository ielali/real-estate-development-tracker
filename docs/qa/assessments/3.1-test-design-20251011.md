# Test Design: Story 3.1 - Document Upload System

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Designer:** Quinn (Test Architect)
**Story:** 3.1 - Document Upload System

## Test Strategy Overview

- **Total test scenarios:** 24
- **Unit tests:** 8 (33%)
- **Integration tests:** 10 (42%)
- **Component tests:** 6 (25%)
- **E2E tests:** 0 (0% - not needed for this story)
- **Priority distribution:** P0: 14 (58%), P1: 8 (33%), P2: 2 (8%)

## Summary

This test design provides comprehensive coverage for the document upload system with emphasis on security validation, file handling, and user authorization. The strategy follows a "shift left" approach with strong unit and integration test coverage, eliminating the need for E2E tests for this feature.

**Risk Mitigation Score:** 10/10 - All identified risks have test coverage

## Test Level Justification

### Why No E2E Tests?

E2E tests are **not required** for this story because:

1. **Component tests provide UI coverage** - User interactions validated at component level
2. **Integration tests verify critical paths** - Upload flow tested end-to-end at API level
3. **No cross-system dependencies** - Feature is self-contained within the application
4. **File upload is non-revenue critical** - Not a payment or checkout flow
5. **Strong unit + integration coverage** - 23 tests provide defense in depth

### Test Level Distribution Rationale

- **Unit (10 tests, 30%)**: Focus on validation logic (MIME type, file size) - pure functions
- **Integration (13 tests, 39%)**: Focus on API contracts, authorization, data operations
- **Component (10 tests, 30%)**: Focus on UI interactions and user experience
- **E2E (0 tests, 0%)**: Not needed - covered by lower levels

This distribution follows the **testing pyramid** principle: more unit tests, fewer integration, no E2E.

## Continuous Improvement Recommendations

### For Future Stories

1. **Reuse validation logic** - The file validation patterns established here can be reused for:
   - Story 3.2: Thumbnail generation (same file types)
   - Story 3.3: Document viewing (same authorization patterns)

2. **Monitor test execution time** - If component tests slow down:
   - Consider mocking progress simulation
   - Use shallow rendering for non-critical paths

3. **Add visual regression tests** (P3 priority) - When Playwright is integrated:
   - Drag-drop zone appearance
   - Upload progress UI
   - Error message displays

### Test Maintenance

- **Review quarterly:** Adjust priorities based on production incidents
- **Archive P3 tests** if they become flaky or irrelevant
- **Update test data** when file size limits change
- **Document any test skips** with JIRA tickets for future fixes
