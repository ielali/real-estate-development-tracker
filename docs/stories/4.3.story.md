## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 4.2 successfully implemented RBAC infrastructure with comprehensive hooks and components:

- **Role Hooks Available**: `useUserRole()`, `useProjectPermission()`, `useAccessibleProjects()` [Source: 4.2.story.md, File List]
- **Permission Components**: `RoleGate`, `PermissionGate`, `PermissionBadge` [Source: 4.2.story.md, File List]
- **Authorization Helpers**: `verifyProjectAccess()`, `getAccessibleProjects()` in `authorization.ts` [Source: 4.2.story.md, Dev Notes]
- **Audit Logging**: `logAccessAttempt()` and `auditLog.listAccessAttempts` query available [Source: 4.2.story.md, Dev Notes]
- **Partner Dashboard**: Consolidated into home page (`/`) with role-based rendering [Source: This story]

**Key Patterns to Reuse:**

- Use `useAccessibleProjects()` hook to fetch projects with permission metadata
- Use `PermissionBadge` component to show read/write indicators
- Use `verifyProjectAccess()` helper in all tRPC queries
- Use audit log queries for activity timeline data
- Test with `createTestContext({ role: "partner" })` for backend tests

**Deferred UI Integration from Story 4.2:**

Tasks 92-99 from Story 4.2 were deferred to this story. However, Story 4.3 focuses on the Partner Dashboard specifically. General UI integration (hiding edit buttons, disabling forms) should be handled separately or in Story 4.5+ if needed.

### Architecture Context

#### Partner Dashboard Component Specification [Source: components.md#PartnerDashboard]

```typescript
interface PartnerDashboardProps {
  projectId: string
  lastViewedAt?: Date
}

interface PartnerMetrics {
  totalSpent: number
  budgetRemaining: number
  categoryBreakdown: CategoryTotal[]
  recentUpdates: AuditLog[]
}
```

**Responsibility:** Professional read-only interface for partners with real-time updates and activity highlights

**Technology Stack:** Role-based component rendering, animated charts with Framer Motion, automatic refresh via React Query

**Implementation Notes:**

- This story implements the full-featured Partner Dashboard (Story 4.2 only created a stub)
- Use React Query for data fetching with automatic background refetching (staleTime: 2min)
- Use Framer Motion for smooth chart animations and transitions
- Implement loading skeletons for all dashboard sections
- Use Chart.js or Recharts for cost breakdown visualizations

#### Data Models [Source: data-models.md]

**Project Interface:**

```typescript
interface Project extends BaseEntity {
  name: string
  description: string | null
  address: Address
  projectType: ProjectType
  status: "active" | "on-hold" | "completed"
  startDate: Date
  endDate: Date | null
  ownerId: string
  totalBudget: number | null
}
```

**Cost Interface:**

```typescript
interface Cost extends BaseEntity {
  projectId: string
  amount: number // in cents
  description: string
  categoryId: string // References Category.id
  date: Date
  contactId: string | null
  createdById: string
}
```

**Document Interface:**

```typescript
interface Document extends BaseEntity {
  projectId: string
  fileName: string
  fileSize: number
  mimeType: string
  blobUrl: string
  thumbnailUrl: string | null
  categoryId: string // References Category.id
  uploadedById: string
}
```

**AuditLog Interface:**

```typescript
interface AuditLog {
  id: string
  projectId: string
  userId: string
  action: AuditAction
  entityType: EntityType
  entityId: string
  changes: Record<string, any> | null
  metadata: AuditMetadata | null
  createdAt: Date
}

interface AuditMetadata {
  displayName?: string // Human-readable description
  amount?: number // For cost-related actions
  fileName?: string // For document uploads
  relatedEntities?: Array<{ type: string; id: string; name: string }>
}
```

**Category System:**

- Use predefined category definitions from `CategoryType`
- Cost categories: materials, labor, permits, professional
- Document categories: photo, receipt, contract, permit
- Event categories: milestone, meeting, inspection
- Helper: `getCategoriesByType(type: CategoryType)` to filter categories

- React Query (TanStack Query) 5.0.0 for data fetching
- Chart.js or Recharts for visualizations
- Framer Motion for animations
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.0 for styling

**Backend:**

- tRPC 10.45.0 for type-safe API
- Drizzle ORM 0.44.6 for database queries
- Zod 3.22.0 for input validation
- Neon PostgreSQL 1.0.2 database
- Netlify Blobs for document storage

**Testing:**

- Vitest 1.6.0 + Testing Library 14.0.0 for frontend tests
- Vitest 1.6.0 for backend tests
- Playwright 1.40.0 for E2E tests

#### UI/UX Standards [Source: coding-standards.md#UI/UX Standards]

**Responsive Design:**

- Design mobile-first, starting at 375px width minimum
- Test at: 375px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px (desktop)
- Use Tailwind's mobile-first breakpoints (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
- All touch targets minimum 44x44px for mobile usability

**Loading States:**

```typescript
// Show skeleton components during initial load
if (isLoading) {
  return <DashboardSkeleton />
}

// Empty state with clear CTA
if (data?.projects.length === 0) {
  return (
    <EmptyState
      title="No projects yet"
      description="You haven't been invited to any projects"
    />
  )
}

// Error state with retry option
if (isError) {
  return <ErrorState message="Failed to load dashboard" action={<Button onClick={refetch}>Try Again</Button>} />
}
```

**Component Patterns:**

- Always use Shadcn/ui components for consistency
- Use React Hook Form + Zod for any forms (though dashboard is read-only)
- Implement proper loading, empty, and error states
- Use optimistic updates where applicable (not needed for read-only dashboard)

**Accessibility (WCAG AA):**

- Semantic HTML elements (nav, main, article, section)
- Proper ARIA labels for icons and charts
- Keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- Screen reader support for chart data (provide table alternative)
- Color contrast ratios 4.5:1 for text
- Support prefers-reduced-motion for animations

#### Security Considerations [Source: coding-standards.md#Security Standards]

**Access Control:**

- All dashboard queries must use `verifyProjectAccess()` helper
- Never trust client-provided user IDs - use `ctx.user.id` from session
- Partners can only access projects they're assigned to via ProjectAccess table
- Verify `acceptedAt IS NOT NULL` to prevent pending invitations from granting access

**Input Validation:**

- Zod schemas for all tRPC procedure inputs
- Validate projectId is UUID format
- Validate pagination parameters (limit: 1-50, offset: >= 0)

**Document Access:**

- Generate signed URLs for document access (security via Netlify Blobs)
- Set appropriate expiry times for signed URLs (e.g., 1 hour)
- Never expose raw blob URLs without access verification

#### Performance Considerations [Source: coding-standards.md#Performance Standards]

**Data Fetching:**

- Use React Query for server state management
- Configure appropriate cache times:
  - Project summary: staleTime 2min, cacheTime 5min
  - Cost breakdown: staleTime 1min, cacheTime 3min
  - Activity feed: staleTime 30sec, cacheTime 2min
  - Document gallery: staleTime 5min, cacheTime 10min
- Prefetch data for predictable navigation
- Debounce search/filter inputs (300ms)

**Database Optimization:**

- Use selective includes (only fetch needed relations)
- Limit query results with pagination
- Use indexes on frequently queried columns (projectId, categoryId, date)
- Batch queries where possible (combine cost totals with category names in single query)

**Frontend Performance:**

- Lazy load chart library (dynamic import)
- Virtualize large lists if needed (e.g., document gallery with 100+ items)
- Optimize images (use Next.js Image component for thumbnails)
- Code splitting for partner-specific components

### Testing

**Backend Tests [Source: testing-strategy.md, coding-standards.md#Testing Standards]:**

- Test location: `apps/web/src/server/__tests__/partner-dashboard.test.ts`
- Use `createTestContext({ role: "partner" })` to test partner access
- Test all tRPC queries return correct data format
- Test access control: partners cannot access unassigned projects
- Test soft-delete filtering: deleted entities excluded from results
- Test pagination: limit and offset parameters work correctly
- Test empty states: queries return appropriate responses for projects with no data

**Frontend Tests [Source: testing-strategy.md, coding-standards.md#Testing Standards]:**

- Test location: Co-located with components in `__tests__/` subfolders
- Test all components render correctly with valid data
- Test loading states display skeletons
- Test empty states display appropriate messages
- Test error states display error messages with retry button
- Test responsive layouts at different breakpoints
- Test chart renders correctly with cost breakdown data
- Test activity timeline groups entries by date
- Test document gallery filters by category

**Integration/E2E Tests:**

- Test location: `apps/web/e2e/tests/partner-dashboard.spec.ts` (to be created)
- Test full partner login → home page → accessible projects display
- Test partner can navigate to project detail pages
- Test role-based rendering (partner vs admin vs guest views)
- Test empty state when partner has no projects
- Test mobile responsive behavior (grid layout adapts)
- Test chart interactions (hover, click) - deferred to advanced viz implementation
- Test document gallery click to view full-size - deferred to advanced viz implementation
- Test activity timeline pagination/infinite scroll - deferred to advanced viz implementation

**Test Pattern Examples:**

```typescript
// Backend test
test("partner can view assigned project summary", async () => {
  const ctx = await createTestContext({ role: "partner" })
  const caller = appRouter.createCaller(ctx)

  // Create project and grant access
  const project = await createProject({ ownerId: "other-user-id" })
  await createProjectAccess({
    projectId: project.id,
    userId: ctx.user.id,
    permission: "read",
    acceptedAt: new Date(),
  })

  const result = await caller.partnerDashboard.getProjectSummary({ projectId: project.id })

  expect(result).toMatchObject({
    project: expect.objectContaining({ id: project.id }),
    totalSpent: expect.any(Number),
    costBreakdown: expect.any(Array),
  })
})

// Frontend test
test("renders project summary card with metrics", () => {
  const mockData = {
    totalSpent: 150000,
    documentCount: 12,
    recentActivityCount: 5,
  }

  render(<ProjectSummaryCard data={mockData} />)

  expect(screen.getByText("$1,500.00")).toBeInTheDocument()
  expect(screen.getByText("12 documents")).toBeInTheDocument()
  expect(screen.getByText("5 recent updates")).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-29

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Grade: B+ (Good with Minor Concerns)**

The implementation demonstrates strong architectural design with comprehensive component separation, proper security controls, and excellent UX patterns. The partner dashboard successfully delivers all required functionality with professional polish. However, test execution issues and some performance considerations prevent a full PASS rating.

**Strengths:**

- **Security**: All tRPC queries properly use `verifyProjectAccess()` for authorization
- **Component Architecture**: Well-structured components with clear separation of concerns
- **UX Excellence**: Comprehensive loading states, error handling, and empty states throughout
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper Tailwind breakpoints
- **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript typing across backend and frontend
- **Visual Polish**: Framer Motion animations and Recharts visualizations enhance UX
- **Code Documentation**: Well-commented backend and frontend code

**Areas of Concern:**

- **Test Execution**: Backend tests exist but require test database configuration to run
- **Test Coverage Gaps**: No frontend component tests implemented
- **Performance**: Document gallery lacks pagination (potential issue with 100+ documents)
- **Signed URLs**: Document gallery uses raw blobUrl instead of signed URLs (security concern)

### Refactoring Performed

**Critical Bug Fixes (3 bugs fixed during review):**

- **File**: [apps/web/src/server/api/routers/partnerDashboard.ts](apps/web/src/server/api/routers/partnerDashboard.ts#L41-L58)
  - **Change**: Added address relation fetch and project re-query after access verification
  - **Why**: Backend was returning project without address relation, causing TypeScript errors in frontend
  - **How**: Added `ctx.db.query.projects.findFirst()` with `with: { address: true }` and proper imports

- **File**: [apps/web/src/components/partner/PartnerProjectDashboard.tsx](apps/web/src/components/partner/PartnerProjectDashboard.tsx#L131)
  - **Change**: Fixed property name from `costBreakdown.totalSpent` to `costBreakdown.grandTotal`
  - **Why**: Backend API returns `grandTotal` but component was accessing non-existent `totalSpent` property
  - **How**: Updated prop binding to match backend API contract

- **File**: [apps/web/src/components/partner/PartnerProjectDashboard.tsx](apps/web/src/components/partner/PartnerProjectDashboard.tsx#L148-L157)
  - **Change**: Added data transformation layer for activity timeline data
  - **Why**: Backend returns nested user object, but ActivityTimeline component expects flat structure with userName
  - **How**: Added `.map()` transform to flatten user data and rename `createdAt` to `timestamp`

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ PASS
  - Proper TypeScript usage with explicit types
  - Consistent naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase)
  - JSDoc comments present on complex functions
  - Security best practices followed (input validation, access control)

- **Tests**: Backend test present ([partner-dashboard.test.ts:211-278](apps/web/src/server/__tests__/partner-dashboard.test.ts#L211-L278))
- **Status**: ✓ Fully Implemented

**AC4: Timeline view of recent activity**

- **Implementation**: ActivityTimeline with date grouping and action icons
- **Backend**: `getRecentActivity` query with pagination support
- **Tests**: Backend test present ([partner-dashboard.test.ts:280-344](apps/web/src/server/__tests__/partner-dashboard.test.ts#L280-L344))
- **Status**: ✓ Implemented (pagination UI incomplete but hasMore always false currently)

**AC5: Document gallery with viewing capability**

- **Implementation**: DocumentGallery with category tabs and lightbox modal
- **Backend**: `getDocumentGallery` query
- **Tests**: Backend test present ([partner-dashboard.test.ts:347-424](apps/web/src/server/__tests__/partner-dashboard.test.ts#L347-L424))
- **Status**: ⚠️ Implemented with concern (missing signed URLs for secure access)

**AC6: Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go access**

- **Implementation**: All components use mobile-first Tailwind breakpoints (sm:, md:, lg:)
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px on interactive elements
- **Tests**: None (responsive tests deferred to E2E)
- **Status**: ✓ Fully Implemented

### Security Review

**Access Control: ✓ PASS**

- All dashboard queries verify project access via `verifyProjectAccess()`
- Partners can only view projects they're explicitly assigned to
- Session validation enforced via `protectedProcedure`
- No client-provided user IDs trusted (always use `ctx.user.id`)

**Data Protection: ⚠️ CONCERNS**

- Document gallery uses raw `blobUrl` instead of signed URLs
- **Risk**: If blob URLs are predictable, unauthorized access possible
- **Recommendation**: Implement Netlify Blobs signed URLs with 1-hour expiry
- **Suggested Fix**: Use `getStore().getSignedUrl()` in `getDocumentGallery` query

**Input Validation: ✓ PASS**

- All tRPC inputs validated with Zod schemas
- UUID format validation on projectId parameters
- Pagination parameters properly bounded (limit: 1-50, offset: ≥0)

### Performance Considerations

**Data Fetching: ✓ ADEQUATE**

- React Query used for server state management
- Multiple parallel queries in PartnerProjectDashboard (good)
- Loading skeletons provide perceived performance

**Database Optimization: ⚠️ CONCERNS**

- Cost breakdown queries use proper aggregation (SUM with GROUP BY)
- Document gallery lacks pagination (**Issue**: with 500+ documents, could impact load times)
- Audit log query properly indexed on `projectId` and `createdAt`
- **Recommendation**: Add pagination to document gallery (e.g., 50 documents per page)

**Frontend Performance: ✓ PASS**

- Charts lazy loaded via dynamic imports
- Framer Motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Currency formatting utility optimized

### Non-Functional Requirements Assessment

**Security: ⚠️ CONCERNS**

- **Status**: CONCERNS
- **Finding**: Document blob URLs not using signed URLs for secure time-limited access
- **Impact**: Medium (URLs may be shareable beyond intended access period)
- **Recommendation**: Implement signed URLs with 1-hour expiry

**Performance: ⚠️ CONCERNS**

- **Status**: CONCERNS
- **Finding**: Document gallery lacks pagination (potential N+1 queries with large datasets)
- **Impact**: Low to Medium (acceptable for <100 documents, problematic beyond)
- **Recommendation**: Add pagination if document count exceeds 50

**Reliability: ✓ PASS**

- **Status**: PASS
- **Finding**: Comprehensive error handling and fallback states throughout
- **Evidence**: Loading, error, and empty states in all components

**Maintainability: ✓ PASS**

- **Status**: PASS
- **Finding**: Well-documented code with clear component structure
- **Evidence**: JSDoc comments, TypeScript types, organized file structure

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Test Coverage: ✓ PASS** (Updated 2025-10-29)

- ✅ Backend unit tests exist and execute successfully (test database configured)

- ⚠️ No integration or E2E tests for partner dashboard flows (deferred)
- **Risk Level**: LOW (reduced from MEDIUM after frontend tests added)

**Test Quality (Backend): ✓ PASS** (Updated 2025-10-29)

- Test patterns follow best practices (arrange-act-assert)
- Comprehensive test cases covering:
  - Owner access ✓
  - Partner read access ✓
  - Unauthorized access (FORBIDDEN) ✓
  - Data aggregation correctness ✓
  - Pagination ✓
- Tests use proper test context creation
