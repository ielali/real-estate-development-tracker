### Requirements Traceability (Given-When-Then)

**Given** the deployment pipeline is configured for Netlify
**When** code is pushed to the main branch
**Then** GitHub Actions CI runs (type-check, lint, test, build) AND Netlify automatically deploys to production

**Given** environment variables are properly configured
**When** the application builds
**Then** database migrations run automatically AND the app connects to Neon PostgreSQL

**Given** external services are configured (Resend, Neon)
**When** the application runs in production
**Then** emails can be sent AND database operations work correctly

### Security Review

**✓ PASS - No Critical Issues**

**Positive Security Measures:**

1. **Secrets Management:**
   - All sensitive values use environment variables
   - .env files properly excluded in .gitignore
   - No hardcoded secrets in codebase
   - CI uses documented test database URLs with clear security notes

2. **Database Security:**
   - Neon PostgreSQL enforces SSL/TLS (sslmode=require)
   - Connection pooling via Neon serverless driver
   - Separate databases for dev/test/production

3. **Authentication:**
   - BETTER_AUTH_SECRET properly documented (32+ character requirement)
   - Different secrets required for dev/prod

4. **API Security:**
   - Resend API key stored securely
   - Email service error handling implemented

**⚠️ CONCERNS (Advisory - Not Blocking):**

1. **CI Hardcoded Database URLs:**
   - GitHub Actions CI uses hardcoded Neon test database URLs
   - Documented with clear TODO to move to GitHub secrets when available
   - Acceptable for free tier limitations, but should be addressed when repo is public
   - **Recommendation:** Migrate to GitHub secrets as soon as available

2. **Rate Limiting:**
