## Dev Notes

### Global Standards Reference

**IMPORTANT:** This story must follow all standards defined in `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`, which is automatically loaded for all development work. Key areas covered:

- UI/UX standards (responsive design, accessibility, loading states)
- Component patterns (address input with autocomplete, form patterns, select components)
- API & backend standards (tRPC patterns, database standards, security)
- Testing standards and patterns

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.3 (Authentication System) implementation:

- tRPC context successfully includes authenticated user session
- `protectedProcedure` middleware available for routes requiring authentication
- User context provides userId for ownership checks
- Database layer working well with Drizzle ORM and SQLite
- Form components established pattern using React Hook Form + Zod + Shadcn/ui
- Testing patterns established with Vitest, dedicated test database infrastructure
- Soft delete pattern already implemented via BaseEntity structure

### Data Models

**Project Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Project]

```typescript
interface Project extends BaseEntity {
  name: string
  description: string | null
  address: Address
  projectType: ProjectType
  status: "active" | "on-hold" | "completed"
  startDate: Date
  endDate: Date | null
  ownerId: string
  totalBudget: number | null
}

type ProjectType = "renovation" | "new_build" | "development" | "maintenance"
```

**Address Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Address]

```typescript
interface Address {
  streetNumber: string
  streetName: string
  streetType: string | null // Street, Road, Avenue, etc.
  suburb: string
  state: AustralianState
  postcode: string
  country: string // Default: 'Australia'
  formatted?: string // Full formatted address for display
}

type AustralianState = "NSW" | "VIC" | "QLD" | "WA" | "SA" | "TAS" | "ACT" | "NT"
```

**BaseEntity** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#BaseEntity]

```typescript
interface BaseEntity {
  id: string // UUID
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
  deletedAt: Date | null // Soft delete support
}
```

### API Specifications

**ProjectService Interface** [Source: architecture/components.md#ProjectService]

```typescript
interface ProjectService {
  create: (data: CreateProjectInput, userId: string) => Promise<Project>
  update: (id: string, data: UpdateProjectInput, userId: string) => Promise<Project>
  softDelete: (id: string, userId: string) => Promise<void>
  getWithPermissions: (id: string, userId: string) => Promise<ProjectWithAccess>
}
```

**tRPC Pattern** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#Core API Patterns]

- All protected procedures validate user sessions via Better-auth middleware
- Zod schemas ensure runtime validation matches TypeScript types
- Standardized tRPC error codes with descriptive messages
- Every mutation should create audit log entries for partner transparency

### File Locations

Based on current project structure:

**Backend (tRPC Routers):**

- Project router: `apps/web/src/server/api/routers/project.ts`
- Root router: `apps/web/src/server/api/root.ts` (add project router here)
- tRPC context: `apps/web/src/server/api/trpc.ts` (already has auth context)

**Frontend (Pages):**

- Projects list: `apps/web/src/app/projects/page.tsx`
- Project detail: `apps/web/src/app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`
- Project edit: `apps/web/src/app/projects/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
- Project create: `apps/web/src/app/projects/new/page.tsx`

**Components:**

- Project forms: `apps/web/src/components/projects/`
- Shared UI components: `apps/web/src/components/ui/` (already has form, button, input, etc.)

**Database:**

- Projects schema: `apps/web/src/server/db/schema/projects.ts` (already exists from Story 1.2)
- User schema: `apps/web/src/server/db/schema/users.ts` (already exists)

### Project Structure Notes

Current structure follows the architecture specification:

- Using Next.js App Router for page organization (`apps/web/src/app/`)
- tRPC routers in `apps/web/src/server/api/routers/`
- Shadcn/ui components already initialized and working
- Database schemas in `apps/web/src/server/db/schema/`
- Form components established pattern from authentication story

### Technical Constraints

**Tech Stack Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **tRPC** ^11.6.0 - Type-safe API layer with Zod validation
- **Zod** ^3.23.0 - Runtime validation at API boundaries (critical for data integrity)
- **React Query** ^5.90.0 - Server state management (perfect tRPC integration)
- **Drizzle ORM** ^0.44.5 - Type-safe database access with SQLite
- **Drizzle Kit** ^0.31.5 - Schema management and migrations
- **Next.js** ^15.5.4 - App Router for pages and layouts
- **Shadcn/ui** ^0.8.0 - UI components (already initialized)

**Database Constraints:**

- Must use UUID primary keys for security
- Soft delete via `deletedAt` field (never hard delete)
- All timestamps auto-managed by Drizzle
- Use transactions for multi-step operations

**Validation Requirements:**

- Server-side Zod validation required on all mutations
- Client-side validation using React Hook Form
- Address fields must follow Australian format
- Project dates: startDate required, endDate optional
- Project name must be unique per user

### tRPC Integration Patterns

**Query/Mutation Pattern:**

```typescript
// In component
const { data, isLoading, error } = api.projects.list.useQuery()
const createProject = api.projects.create.useMutation({
  onSuccess: () => {
    // Show toast, navigate, etc.
  },
  onError: (error) => {
    // Handle error
  },
})
```

### Testing

**Testing Requirements** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

Test file locations:

- Backend unit tests: `apps/web/src/server/__tests__/project.test.ts`
- Component tests: `apps/web/src/components/projects/__tests__/`
- Integration tests: `apps/web/integration/api/__tests__/project.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `apps/web/e2e/tests/project-crud.spec.ts`

Testing patterns to follow:

- Use Vitest for unit and integration tests
- Use Testing Library for component tests
- Use Playwright for E2E tests
- Use dedicated test database (from Story 1.3 pattern)
- Follow existing test patterns from authentication tests

Example backend test structure:

```typescript
import { appRouter } from "../api/root"
import { createTestContext } from "@/test/test-db"

test("creates project with valid input", async () => {
  const ctx = await createTestContext()
  const caller = appRouter.createCaller(ctx)

  const result = await caller.projects.create({
    name: "Test Project",
    address: {
      /* ... */
    },
    startDate: new Date(),
    projectType: "renovation",
  })

  expect(result).toMatchObject({
    name: "Test Project",
    ownerId: ctx.user.id,
  })
})
```

Example component test structure:

```typescript
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { ProjectCreateForm } from '../ProjectCreateForm';

test('submits project creation with valid data', async () => {
  const onSuccess = vi.fn();
  render(<ProjectCreateForm onSuccess={onSuccess} />);

  fireEvent.change(screen.getByLabelText(/name/i), {
    target: { value: 'New Project' }
  });
  // Fill other fields...
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /create/i }));

  await waitFor(() => expect(onSuccess).toHaveBeenCalled());
});
```

### Audit Logging Note

While audit logging is mentioned in the architecture, Story 1.4 focuses on basic CRUD operations. Audit logging will likely be implemented in a future story when the AuditService is built. For now, ensure the project operations work correctly without audit logging.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Quality: STRONG** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (85/100)

The implementation demonstrates solid architecture with excellent attention to security, type safety, and error handling. All 6 acceptance criteria are fully implemented with comprehensive backend test coverage (11 passing tests). The tRPC router follows established patterns with proper access control, Zod validation, and soft delete filtering.

**Strengths:**

- Excellent ownership-based access control prevents unauthorized data access
- Comprehensive backend tests cover all CRUD operations and edge cases
- TypeScript strict mode compliance with no compilation errors
- Proper optimistic updates with rollback on error
- Well-structured code with clear separation of concerns

**Areas for Improvement:**

- Component tests deferred to future story (medium priority)
- Code duplication identified and refactored during review (completed)

### Refactoring Performed

#### 1. Eliminated Code Duplication in Form Validation Schemas

- **Files Created**:
  - `apps/web/src/lib/validations/project.ts` - Shared validation schemas and constants

- **Files Refactored**:
  - `apps/web/src/components/projects/ProjectCreateForm.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/components/projects/ProjectEditForm.tsx`

- **Change**: Extracted duplicated Zod schemas, project types, statuses, and address validation into centralized validation file

- **Why**: Both form components had identical validation schemas (70+ lines duplicated), violating DRY principle and making maintenance difficult

- **How**: Created shared schemas (`projectCreateFormSchema`, `projectEditFormSchema`) that both components now import, ensuring consistency and single source of truth

- **Verification**: All 45 tests passing, TypeScript compilation successful with strict mode

### Compliance Check

- ✅ **Coding Standards**: Fully compliant
  - TypeScript strict mode passing
  - Proper JSDoc comments on all components
  - Consistent naming conventions (PascalCase, camelCase)
  - Proper error handling with user feedback

- ✅ **Project Structure**: Fully compliant
  - Files organized per architecture specification
  - tRPC routers in correct location
  - Components properly co-located
  - Proper import organization

- ✅ **Testing Strategy**: Partially compliant
  - Backend unit tests: ✅ Excellent (11 tests covering all CRUD operations)
  - Access control tests: ✅ Complete (ownership verification on all mutations)
  - Component tests: ⚠️ Deferred to future story (acknowledged in tasks)

- ✅ **All ACs Met**: Yes - All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Requirements Traceability Matrix

**Given-When-Then mapping of Acceptance Criteria to Tests:**

**AC1: Project creation form with name, address, start date fields**

- **Given** user is authenticated
- **When** user submits valid project data via creation form
- **Then** project is created with correct fields
- **Tests**: `project.test.ts:71-111` (creates project with valid input)
- **Tests**: `project.test.ts:113-142` (requires name field)
- **Tests**: `project.test.ts:144-173` (validates postcode format)

**AC2: Projects list view showing all user's projects as cards**

- **Given** user has created projects
- **When** user views projects list page
- **Then** only their projects are displayed
- **Tests**: `project.test.ts:177-236` (returns only user's projects)
- **Tests**: `project.test.ts:238-289` (excludes soft-deleted projects)

**AC3: Project detail page displaying project information**

- **Given** user owns a project
- **When** user views project detail page
- **Then** full project information is displayed
- **Tests**: `project.test.ts:293-326` (returns project by ID for owner)
- **Tests**: `project.test.ts:328-368` (throws error for unauthorized access)

**AC4: Edit functionality to update project details**

- **Given** user owns a project
- **When** user submits updated project data
- **Then** project is updated successfully
- **Tests**: `project.test.ts:372-408` (updates project successfully)
- **Tests**: `project.test.ts:410-455` (prevents updating another user's project)

**AC5: Soft delete capability to archive projects**

- **Given** user owns a project
- **When** user confirms deletion
- **Then** project is soft deleted (deletedAt set)
- **Tests**: `project.test.ts:459-495` (soft deletes successfully)
- **Tests**: `project.test.ts:497-537` (prevents deleting another user's project)

**AC6: Proper validation and error handling on all operations**

- **Coverage**: All test cases validate proper error handling
- **Server-side**: Zod schemas on all tRPC procedures
- **Client-side**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Edge cases**: Invalid postcodes, empty names, unauthorized access all tested

### Security Review

**Status: ✅ EXCELLENT**

- **Authentication**: All project operations behind `protectedProcedure` middleware
- **Authorization**: Ownership checks on all mutations (create, update, delete)
- **Data Isolation**: Users can only access their own projects via `ownerId` filtering
- **Soft Delete**: Proper implementation prevents data resurrection attacks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive Zod schemas at API boundary
- **SQL Injection**: Protected by Drizzle ORM parameterized queries
- **Error Messages**: Proper generic messages don't leak sensitive data

**No security concerns identified.**

### Performance Considerations

**Status: ✅ GOOD**

- **Optimistic Updates**: Delete operation implements optimistic UI with rollback
- **Caching**: React Query caching properly configured via tRPC
- **Query Optimization**: Uses `leftJoin` for address data (efficient single query)
- **Loading States**: All pages implement proper loading skeletons
- **Bundle Size**: No unnecessary dependencies added

**No performance concerns identified.**

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Backend Tests: ✅ EXCELLENT (11 tests, 100% passing)**

- Comprehensive CRUD operation coverage
- Access control scenarios thoroughly tested
- Edge cases and validation tested
- Proper test isolation with fresh database per test
- Uses established test patterns from Story 1.3

**Component Tests: ⚠️ DEFERRED**

- Story explicitly acknowledges deferral in tasks (line 86-89)
- Backend coverage provides solid foundation
- Recommended for future story to test:
  - Form validation and error messages
  - User interaction flows
  - Loading and error states
  - Optimistic update behavior

**Test Level Appropriateness: ✅ CORRECT**

- Backend logic tested at unit level (appropriate)
- Access control at integration level (appropriate)
- Frontend behavior acknowledged for component level (appropriate deferral)

### Files Modified During Review

**Created:**

- `apps/web/src/lib/validations/project.ts` - Shared validation schemas (refactoring)

**Modified:**

- `apps/web/src/components/projects/ProjectCreateForm.tsx` - Now imports shared schemas
- `apps/web/src/components/projects/ProjectEditForm.tsx` - Now imports shared schemas

**Note**: Dev should update File List section to include new validation file.

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → `docs/qa/gates/1.4-project-crud-operations.yml`

**Decision Rationale:**

- Strong implementation with excellent backend coverage
- Security and architecture are sound
- Component tests acknowledged as deferred (medium priority gap)
- Code quality improved through refactoring

**Quality Score: 85/100**

### Recommended Status

**✅ Ready for Done** (with notes)

**Reasoning:**

- All acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested at backend level
- Component tests explicitly deferred per story tasks
- Security, performance, and reliability requirements met
- Code quality improved during review
- No blocking issues identified

**Action Items for Dev:**

1. Update File List to include new validation file created during QA refactoring
2. Consider scheduling component test story for next sprint
3. Review refactored validation schemas for any team preferences

**Final Note:** This is production-ready code. The CONCERNS gate reflects missing component tests, which were explicitly deferred in the story plan. The backend implementation is solid and secure.
