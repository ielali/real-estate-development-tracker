### Development Workflow Commands
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
```bash
# Development commands to be configured:
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run type-check   # Run type checking
npm run lint         # Run linting
npm run format       # Run formatting
npm run test         # Run tests
```

### Environment Variables
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
Initial .env.example should include:
```
NODE_ENV=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```
Note: Authentication and database variables will be added in future stories.

### Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Framework**: Vitest ^1.6.0 for both frontend and backend tests
- **Test Organization**: Tests should be organized in `__tests__` directories adjacent to source files
- **Test Location Pattern**: `src/components/__tests__/`, `src/lib/__tests__/`
- Note: Full testing setup will be implemented in future stories. This story focuses on basic setup validation only.

### Technical Constraints
- Node.js version must be 18+ 
- npm version must be 9+
- All package versions must match those specified in tech-stack.md exactly
- Monorepo must use Turborepo for build optimization
- Must follow the exact directory structure from unified-project-structure.md
