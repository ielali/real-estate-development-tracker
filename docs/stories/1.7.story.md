## Dev Notes

### Global Standards Reference

**IMPORTANT:** This story must follow all standards defined in `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`, which is automatically loaded for all development work.

### Architecture Context

**Project Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

The project follows a Turborepo monorepo structure:

```
realestate-portfolio/
├── .github/workflows/              # CI/CD workflows
├── apps/
│   └── web/                       # Next.js fullstack application
│       ├── src/

```

**Documentation Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Code Documentation]

**JSDoc Comment Pattern:**

```typescript
/**
 * ProjectCreateForm - Form component for creating new projects
 *
 * Handles project creation with address autocomplete, validation,
 * and optimistic updates. Falls back to manual address entry if
 * autocomplete fails or user can't find their address.
 *
 * @param onSuccess - Callback fired after successful project creation
 * @param defaultValues - Optional initial form values
 */
```

**Component Documentation Requirements:**

- JSDoc comments required for all public functions and components
- Include @param, @returns, and @throws where applicable
- Document complex business logic with inline comments
- Explain "why" not "what" in comments

**File Organization:**

- One component per file (except tightly coupled helpers)
- Co-locate related files (component + styles + tests in same directory)
- Use index.ts for clean exports from directories
- Group imports: external libraries → internal modules → relative imports

### Technology Stack Reference

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Key Technologies:**

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, Shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes, tRPC, Drizzle ORM
- **Database:** Neon PostgreSQL (all environments)
- **Testing:** Vitest (unit/integration), Playwright (E2E)
- **Deployment:** Netlify with GitHub Actions CI
- **Package Manager:** Bun ^1.0.0
- **Build Tool:** Turborepo

### Testing Organization

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test File Structure:**

```
Frontend Tests:
  src/components/__tests__/
  src/hooks/__tests__/
  src/lib/__tests__/
  e2e/tests/

Backend Tests:
  src/server/__tests__/
  src/lib/__tests__/
  integration/api/__tests__/
```

**Test Patterns to Document:**

- Frontend component tests with Testing Library
- Backend API tests with tRPC callers
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Integration tests for complete CRUD workflows

### Existing Documentation

**Current State:**

- README.md exists with basic setup instructions
- Architecture documentation exists in `/docs/architecture/` (sharded, v4)
- PRD documentation exists in `/docs/prd/` (sharded, v4)
- Design documentation exists in `/docs/design/wireframes/`
- Story documentation exists in `/docs/stories/`

**Missing Documentation (To Be Created):**

- `/docs/api/` - API documentation folder
- `/docs/components/` - Component documentation folder
- `/docs/guides/` - Development guides folder
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture overview linking to detailed docs
- Individual guide files (local-development.md, testing.md, deployment.md, troubleshooting.md)

### Development Workflow

[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

**Local Development Setup:**

1. Prerequisites: Node.js 18+, Bun, Git
2. Clone repository
3. Install dependencies with `bun install`
4. Configure environment variables (copy .env.example to .env.local)
5. Initialize database: `bun run db:migrate`
6. Seed database (optional): `bun run db:seed`
7. Start dev server: `bun run dev`

**Environment Variables:**

- Development uses Neon PostgreSQL via NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL
- Better-auth requires BETTER_AUTH_SECRET (32+ chars)
- Optional services: RESEND_API_KEY, BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN, NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY

### Deployment Architecture

[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

**Deployment Platform:** Netlify

- Build Command: `cd apps/web && bun run db:migrate && bun run build`
- Publish Directory: `apps/web/.next`
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions (testing) + Netlify (deployment)

**External Services:**

- Neon PostgreSQL for database (all environments)
- Resend for email delivery
- Netlify Blobs for file storage

### File Locations for New Documentation

Based on project structure:

- `/docs/api/README.md` - API documentation index
- `/docs/components/README.md` - Component documentation index
- `/docs/guides/README.md` - Guides index
- `/docs/guides/local-development.md` - Local setup guide
- `/docs/guides/testing.md` - Testing guide
- `/docs/guides/deployment.md` - Deployment guide
- `/docs/guides/troubleshooting.md` - Troubleshooting guide
- `/CONTRIBUTING.md` - Root level contribution guidelines

### Important Notes

**Deployment Guide Note:**

- DEPLOYMENT.md already exists at root level (created in Story 1.6)
- New deployment guide in `/docs/guides/deployment.md` should complement and reference DEPLOYMENT.md
- Avoid duplication - link to existing detailed DEPLOYMENT.md for Netlify-specific setup
- Focus `/docs/guides/deployment.md` on general deployment concepts and workflow

**README Enhancement:**

- Current README.md has good structure but can be enhanced
- Ensure consistency between README.md and new documentation
- Add references to new documentation sections
