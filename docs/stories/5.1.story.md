## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

This is **Story 5.1** of **Epic 5: UI/UX Refinement & Polish**, which is a **brownfield enhancement** to the completed MVP (Epics 1-4). Epic 5 is marked as **HIGH PRIORITY** and should be completed before adding new features (Epics 6-9).

**Epic 5 Goal:** Elevate the user experience across all existing MVP screens by conducting a comprehensive UX audit and implementing improvements for accessibility, mobile responsiveness, visual consistency, and workflow efficiency.

**Story 5.1 Goal:** This is a **planning and documentation story** that produces the blueprint for Stories 5.2 and 5.3. The deliverables are documents, wireframes, and guidelines—not code implementation.

### Existing MVP Screens (Epics 1-4)

Based on the completed MVP epics, the following screens exist and must be audited:

**Epic 1 - Foundation & Core Project Management:**

- Project list page (view all projects)
- Project creation form
- Project detail page
- User authentication (login/signup)

**Epic 2 - Financial Tracking & Contact Management:**

- Cost management page (list, add, edit costs)
- Cost entry form
- Cost categories management
- Vendor list and detail pages
- Contact list and detail pages

**Epic 3 - Document Management & Timeline:**

- Document/photo upload interface
- Document list with preview
- Project timeline view
- Timeline event creation

**Epic 4 - Partner Transparency & Professional Dashboards:**

- Partner invitation flow
- Partner dashboard (read-only view)
- Data visualizations (cost breakdowns, trends)

### Technology Stack for UI/UX Audit

**UI Framework:** Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI
**Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
**Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript
**Icons:** Lucide React or similar icon library
**Charts:** Recharts for data visualizations (Epic 4)

### Current Design Patterns (from Architecture)

**Shadcn/ui Components Used:**

- Button, Input, Select, Textarea
- Form (React Hook Form integration)
- Card, Dialog, Popover, Tooltip
- Table, Dropdown Menu
- Responsive layout with Tailwind breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl)

**Existing Standards (from [coding-standards.md](docs/architecture/coding-standards.md)):**

- Mobile-first responsive design (375px minimum)
- WCAG AA accessibility compliance target
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Form accessibility with associated labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Loading states with skeleton components
- Error handling with toast notifications
- Optimistic updates for mutations

### UX Audit Methodology

**Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics** (industry standard for heuristic evaluation):

1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

**Accessibility Audit Tools:**

- **axe DevTools** (browser extension for WCAG compliance)
- **Lighthouse** (Chrome DevTools for performance and accessibility scores)
- **WAVE** (WebAIM accessibility evaluation tool)
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing (VoiceOver on macOS/iOS, NVDA on Windows)

**Mobile Testing Requirements:**

- Test on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- Test at breakpoints: 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1920px
- Test touch interactions (tap, swipe, pinch-to-zoom)
- Test with slow 3G network throttling

### Design System Framework

Follow atomic design principles for component categorization:

- **Tokens:** Colors, typography, spacing, shadows
- **Atoms:** Buttons, inputs, icons
- **Molecules:** Form fields, cards, list items
- **Organisms:** Forms, tables, navigation, dashboards
- **Templates:** Page layouts

Reference Shadcn/ui's design system as a baseline, extending with custom tokens for "real estate professional branding" (per tech-stack.md).

### Wireframing and Mockup Tools

**Recommended approach:**

- Use Figma, Sketch, or similar design tools for wireframes
- Export wireframes as PNG/SVG to `docs/ux-audit/wireframes/`
- Include annotations explaining design decisions
- Provide both desktop (1440px) and mobile (375px) views
- Include interactive states (hover, focus, disabled, error)

**Alternative (if design tools unavailable):**

- Use detailed markdown descriptions with ASCII diagrams
- Reference existing Shadcn/ui component examples
- Create before/after comparison screenshots

### User Journey Mapping

**Journey Map Components:**

- **Stages:** Key steps in the workflow
- **Actions:** What the user does at each stage
- **Touchpoints:** Screens and interactions
- **Thoughts:** What the user is thinking
- **Emotions:** User sentiment (frustrated, confused, confident, satisfied)
- **Pain points:** Specific issues encountered
- **Opportunities:** Areas for improvement

**Metrics to Track:**

- Time to complete task (current vs. proposed)
- Number of clicks/taps required
- Error rate (validation failures, wrong selections)
- Abandonment points (where users give up)
